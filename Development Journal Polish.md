```markdown
- The thing that I found myself researching for this task is how to create particle systems in Unity and how to activate them with a script.

# Example

As I have done research regarding the audio identity and developing audio assets for this project in previous formative assignments. I wanted to look into specific Unreal and Wwise systems that will help create a more immersive experience. I wanted to focus on official documentation to improve my ability to learn new techniques without explicit instructions.

I also wanted a creative source to help develop the parachute audio assets and learn how it should function within the gameâ€™s narrative.

# Documentation
For my game I wanted to create a particle system that looks like dust and plays whenever the player lands back on the ground. To do this I research into creating particle systems. This led me to looking at the unity documentation on particle systems. (Technologies, s.d.)

I found the particle system documentation to be helpful with creating my dust particle system as it explains everything that I need to know about particle systems. Using this I was able to change the colour, size and lifetime of the particle system to make it look like a dust affect.

I found this unity documentation to be difficult to read as the details on everthing to do with the partcile system is split into so many pages that it is hard to find what you need.

# Game Source
Call of Duty Black Ops 6 is a first person shooter developed by Treyarch and Raven Software, it feature lots of particle systems that are used for many different things within the game(Call Of Duty Black Ops 6, 2024).

Within the game, particle affects are used for so many different things such as gun fire, grenades and vehicle explosions, with most of the particle affects being unique from each other. 

The particle affects make the gameplay feel so much more realistic then if they werent in the game as grenades and smoke and explosions will be going off all around you as you play.

## Implementation

### What was the process of completing the task? What influenced your decision making?

- The first step I took for this task was to find audio for walking and landing to use online and then importing them into unity and I attatched them to audio sources on the main character to be activated within the code.
- I then started programming the walking audio so that whenever the player is moving and the walking audio isn't playing, it plays.

<br>

```csharp
        if (movement.magnitude > 0)
        {
            rb.AddForce(movement * moveSpeed);

            // Play walking audio only if it's not already playing
            if (!audioSources[moveAudioIndex].isPlaying)
            {
                audioSources[moveAudioIndex].Play();
                Debug.Log("Walking audio started.");
            }
        }
        else
        {
            if (audioSources[moveAudioIndex].isPlaying)
            {
                audioSources[moveAudioIndex].Stop();
                Debug.Log("Walking audio stopped.");
            }
        }
```
*Figure 1. Shows my script that plays the walking audio when the player is moving and the audio isn't already playing. If the player stops moving and the audio is playing, the audio stops playing.

- Next I worked on getting the landing audio to play when the player lands back on the ground.

```csharp
    private void OnCollisionEnter(Collision other)
    {
        if (other.gameObject.tag == "Ground")
        {
            isGrounded = true;
            audioSources[groundAudioIndex].Play();
        }
    }
```
*Figure 2. This is the script I used to play the landing audio whenever the player collides with the ground*

- After getting the audio working, I got the particle system to player when the player lands.

```csharp
    private void OnCollisionEnter(Collision other)
    {
        if (other.gameObject.tag == "Ground")
        {
            isGrounded = true;
            audioSources[groundAudioIndex].Play();
            TriggerDustAffect();
        }
    } 
```
*Figure 3. The script I used to activate the TriggerDustEffect method*

```csharp
   private void TriggerDustAffect()
    {
        // Ensure that dust particles are only triggered when the player actually lands
        if (dustParticleSystem != null)
        {
            // Trigger the dust effect only when grounded
            dustEmission.enabled = true;
            dustParticleSystem.Play();
            Debug.Log("Dust particle system triggered.");
        }
    }
```
*Figure 4. This script checks that the dust particle system exists then it enables the particle system then plays it.*

## Critical Reflection

### What did or did not work well and why?

- What did not work well? What parts of the assignment that you felt did not fit the brief or ended up being lacklustre.
- What did you think went very well? Were there any specific aspects you thought were very good?

### What would you do differently next time?

- Are there any new approaches, methodologies or different software that you wish to incorporate if you have another chance?
- Is there another aspect you believe should have been the focus?
